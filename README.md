# timeseries-react-boilerplate

This boilerplate will allow development of mendix widgets using typescript and react with JSX. 

To get started unzip the repo into the root directory of your Mendix project. It's best to add this folder to the SVN ignore list. 
Then open the file with your favorite text editor and run 'npm install' in this folder. After the installation process has finished you can build the widget by running 'npm run build'. The widget is automatically copied to the widgets folder and is available in the mendix project. 


The widget that is output by the boilerplate is a basic Hello World widget that allows you to diplay a message that is editable in the modeler and/or from a context object.
